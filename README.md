There are two music files in this repository in .wav format. I have created a function in "overlap_music_files.py" module to overlap the two music files. 
In the python notebook- <b>"Overlapping_2_music_files.ipynb"</b>, I have loaded the two audio files-  <b>"sample_wavefile1.wav"</b> and <b>"sample_wavefile2.wav"</b> and overlapped them and saved it to a new file - <b>"overlapped_file.wav"</b>

<b>pydub</b> module is required to be installed andfirst on the system to run these files.
